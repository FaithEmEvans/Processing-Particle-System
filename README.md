Key Cmds:

z = Cycles through the particle images

// ] = Makes the particle size larger

// [ = Makes the particle size smaller

// r = Random particle width/height

// R = Resets particle size to 100x100px

// m = Increases acceleration rate

// n = Decreases acceleration rate

// p = Pauses the sketch

// o = Starts the sketch

// 0-9 = Erasure rate 

// c = Clear erasure 

// b = Changes the bg (rrr,GGG,BBB) to mouseX & mouseY position

// B = Resets the bg to default blue 

// < = Increases the bg color for (RRR,ggg,bbb)

// > = Decreases the bg color for (RRR,ggg,bbb)

// warning: flashing

// t = Turns on random tint for the particle

// T = Turns off random tint
